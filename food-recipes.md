### Torta de Milhojas

To prepare a traditional Torta Milhojas (Thousand Layers Cake), a beloved Chilean dessert, follow this detailed recipe. This cake features layers of crispy dough filled with rich dulce de leche and often includes walnuts for added texture.
Ingredients
For the Dough:
3 cups sifted flour
250 grams (8 oz) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3 egg yolks, at room temperature
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon rum or pisco
1 pinch of salt
For the Filling:
3 cups dulce de leche (or caramel)
2 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1/4 cup powdered sugar
Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the butter in chunks, egg yolks, milk, and rum or pisco. Mix using a fork or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment until a medium consistency dough forms. Avoid using your hands to prevent the butter from melting.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
Roll Out the Dough:
Divide the chilled dough into 14 equal portions. Roll each piece on a floured surface until very thin (about 1/8 inch thick). Use a plate to cut circles approximately 8-9 inches in diameter.
Pierce each circle with a fork to prevent puffing during baking.
Bake the Dough:
Place the circles on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until golden. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
Assemble the Cake:
Take one baked circle and spread 3-4 tablespoons of dulce de leche on top. Sprinkle some chopped walnuts over the dulce de leche.
Repeat layering with the remaining circles, alternating between layers of dulce de leche and walnuts. Typically, you can add walnuts every three layers.
Once all layers are stacked, cover the entire cake with a thin layer of dulce de leche.
Decorate:
For decoration, mix the remaining walnuts with powdered sugar and sprinkle it on top of the cake.
Chill and Serve:
Cover the cake and let it rest in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld. Serve at room temperature.
Notes
This cake is often enjoyed during special occasions in Chile, such as birthdays and national celebrations. The combination of crispy layers and sweet filling makes it a favorite among many.
Enjoy your homemade Torta Milhojas, a delightful representation of Chilean culinary tradition!

### Brazo de Reina

To make a delicious Brazo de Reina, a traditional Chilean rolled cake filled with dulce de leche, follow this recipe. This dessert is known for its light sponge cake and rich caramel filling, often topped with coconut.
Ingredients
For the Cake:
5 large eggs, at room temperature
¾ cup caster sugar (or granulated sugar blended to a fine powder)
1 cup cake flour, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon salt
For the Filling:
1 ½ cups dulce de leche (manjar)
Optional: shredded coconut for topping
Instructions
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a jelly roll pan (or a shallow baking sheet) with parchment paper and lightly grease it.
Prepare the Batter:
In a large bowl, separate the egg yolks and whites. In a bowl with the yolks, add half of the sugar and beat until the mixture is pale and creamy. Stir in the vanilla extract.
In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.
Gently fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sift the flour over the mixture and fold gently until just combined.
Bake the Cake:
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the center springs back when touched.
Once baked, remove from the oven and immediately turn the cake out onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with powdered sugar. Peel off the parchment paper.
Roll the Cake:
While the cake is still warm, roll it up tightly with the towel, starting from one short end. Let it cool completely in this rolled shape.
Fill the Cake:
Once cooled, carefully unroll the cake. Spread the dulce de leche evenly over the surface, leaving a small border around the edges.
Roll the cake back up without the towel, ensuring it’s tight but not too tight to avoid tearing.
Decorate:
Place the rolled cake seam-side down on a serving platter. Spread additional dulce de leche over the top and sprinkle with shredded coconut if desired.
Chill and Serve:
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set. Slice and serve chilled or at room temperature.
Notes
This cake is often enjoyed during afternoon tea or special occasions in Chile. Variations may include different fillings like fruit jams or chocolate cream.
Enjoy your homemade Brazo de Reina, a delightful treat that showcases the rich flavors of Chilean cuisine!
